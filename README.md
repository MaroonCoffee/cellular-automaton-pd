# Prisoner's Dilemma Cellular Automaton

This cellular automaton simulates the classic "prisoner's dilemma" and creates beautiful fractal patterns while doing so. For more information, see the paper that inspired this program.

There are several parameters you can change in the script, the most important one being the b value which changes how the cellular automaton behaves.

To start or pause the simulation, press the space bar. 
To reset the screen back to its start state, press 'c'.
You can also toggle cells manually by clicking them.
